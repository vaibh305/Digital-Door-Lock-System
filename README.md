# Digital-Door-Lock-System
Using 4-Digit combination of numbers as password , the door can be locked and unlocked.

Project Working:
Note: Simulation is done on PROTEUS
      Hex file is generated by using KEIL
      
1.Initially door is Locked.
2.Door open for certain period of time and then automatically locked after some delay here 3sec.
3.Default Password is : 123#
4.Keypad used is of Old Mobiles Keypad which has following structure :
  1  2  3
  4  5  6
  7  8  9
  *  0  #
  
# Files Explained:
main_door-lock-passwd.c -->Main Code
i2cB.c --> Code for I2C Protocol
keypad.c -->Keypad Code for sensing which key is pressed
delay.c --> For generating delays in milliseconds and microseconds
lcd.c --> LCD code  

  
  
#  This program also has a code for getting password , if in case user forgot the current password.
  Note that this point is applicable if default password is changed.
#  For recovering password we have to use the file Forgot_Password.c with following files :
# COMPILE IT SEPERATELY with following FILES
    ADD FILES IN SOURCE GROUP: (keil)
    i2cB.c
    lcd.c
    delay.c
